This site is set up so the community has a place to easily upload content to.

# Contributing

Head over to [the repo](https://github.com/gflinfo/gflinfo.github.io). Fork it 
and feel free to send PR.

If you are a member of "Official en GirlsFrontline discord" mod, feel free to
ping me to get admin permission of the repo. I'm not precious about it and
want this site to be in the hands of community.

# Where to edit / add stuff

Just make a copy of a post and edit it however you like. Note you have to prefix
the file with yyyy-mm-dd.

For images, chuck it into assets folder.


# Motivation

It is built in Jekyll and hosted on github pages. It is free.

It comes with issue tracking and content submission process built in. So I
thought why not.
