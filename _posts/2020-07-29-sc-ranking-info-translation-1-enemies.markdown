## SF

### Pyxis
- In SC, there's no Pyxis that moves.
- The attack is like judge. It locks on to two targets and shoot 4 times in a row. It attacks very fast and deals 50% damage of it's firepower stat. The only difference is that it has mediocre accuracy.
- Not so threatening to the SG, but the damage can still add up as it can shoot very quickly. Bringing shield skill is recommended.
- Evasive tanks like SMG will take moderate damage.
- HG will have a tough time tanking the hits from this.


## Paradeus

### Abandoned Isomer
![isomer](/assets/sc-mobs/01-isomer.png)
- This enemy does not have normal attack
- It moves every 4 seconds. Upon moving, it will stun all units within 2 unit radius. The stun last 2s.
  Because it has ??50% coverage?? of stun. Once it enters our echelon, it will severely affect the kiting and damage output.
- It has medium to high evasion. It's threat level largely depends on the mob composition and starting position.
  In SC, it mostly appears by itself and it no very threatening.
  If it has other meatshield at front, it can easily cause problems. Or another annoying comp is close spawn followed by other damage dealers.
  In the rankings 140k CE boss battle, the boss at front soaks the damage while the abandoned isomers slowly closes in and stun everyone.
- If it's stunned during moving, the abandoned isomer's stun itself will be skipped.

### Roarer
- This is a normal mob. Purple will deal 45x damage to it
- Its armor is relatively low, a bit like Manticores.
- Immune to stuns.
- It will taunt attack when it glows blue. The mechanics is a bit like Contender's skill.

However, skills that has its own targeting mechanism will override it.

SMG and HG can trigger the blue ball attack by walking up to it. When it raises its hand above its head, walking away will cause the attack to miss.

Take note that moving away does not interrupt the attack. So if the kiting unit moves away too early, it can potentially cause the attack to splah the back line.

If the dolls are hit by the blue ball attack, its movement speed and rate of fire is decreased.

Roarer's blue ball attack can miss and hit empty air.

The blue ball attack link splashes, so shield can work effectively against it. The blue ball attack deals 80% of its firepower stats. It mostly deals around 30 to 40 damage per link in SC.

Normal attack is melee and doesn't seem to do much. Taunt often fails to block the ones walking down side lanes.

It can replenish its own force field. It replenishes 300 at a time. HOC can deal with these units quite easily. However, if the fight drags on for too long without HOC, they can become hard to kill.


### Thunder
![thunder](/assets/sc-mobs/10-thunder.gif)
- This enemy is an elite. Purple does not do :bigd:
- It has 100+ armor. RF would not have much problem with it, but desert eagle would struggle.
- It does not come with other enemy in SC.
- It is immune to stun.
- It has an mode cycle of 16s. 10s shield and 6s evasion.
- Because it always comes single linked, so its normal attack in shield mode isn't too threatening. However its shield is really, really, really thick. Evasion mode attacks twice, fixed. The attack is guaranteed to hit and does not do link splash damage. It will jump to a fixed distance in front of the attack target.
- It will attack the taunt in evasive mode and not hit the backline. If it attacks the front row doll, it may hit the backline.
![thunder](/assets/sc-mobs/11-thunder.gif)
- Currently, using sure hit skills to kill it during the evasion mode seems to be the better way to approach this enemy.
- AR echelons with type 59 can get by.
- Desert eagle can attack it during the shield mode.
- HOC has 40% base hit rate. If the team can last long enough, you can whittle it down with HOC.

### Gunners
![gunners](/assets/sc-mobs/12-streletes-plus.png)
- 50+ FP and evasion debuff. This thing hurts like hell against evasion tanks and easily critically damage HGs.
- One of the few rare units from paradeus that will chew through taunt.
- There are normal and special attacks from these guys. Blue bullets are the special attack and green bullets are normal attack.
![gunners](/assets/sc-mobs/13-streletes-plus.gif)
- its skill has 3s icd and 3s cd. Every time it uses its skill, the hit target accuracy and evasion will be debuffed by 20%. Maximum 3 stacks for a total of 48.8% decrease.
![gunners](/assets/sc-mobs/14-streletes-plus.gif)
- These guys cannot be kited. Once locked on, they attack 100% lands.
- 0 AP. They do not have armor penetration rating. However, whether shotguns are suitable in tanking them are something else altogether.
