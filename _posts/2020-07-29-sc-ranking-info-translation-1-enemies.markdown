## SF

### Pyxis
- In SC, there's no Pyxis that moves.
- The attack is like judge. It locks on to two targets and shoot 4 times in a row. It attacks very fast and deals 50% damage of it's firepower stat. The only difference is that it has mediocre accuracy.
- Not so threatening to the SG, but the damage can still add up as it can shoot very quickly. Bringing shield skill is recommended.
- Evasive tanks like SMG will take moderate damage.
- HG will have a tough time tanking the hits from this.


## Paradeus

### Abandoned Isomer
![isomer](/assets/sc-mobs/01-isomer.png)
- This enemy does not have normal attack
- It moves every 4 seconds. Upon moving, it will stun all units within 2 unit radius. The stun last 2s.
  Because it has ??50% coverage?? of stun. Once it enters our echelon, it will severely affect the kiting and damage output.
- It has medium to high evasion. It's threat level largely depends on the mob composition and starting position.
  In SC, it mostly appears by itself and it no very threatening.
  If it has other meatshield at front, it can easily cause problems. Or another annoying comp is close spawn followed by other damage dealers.
  In the rankings 140k CE boss battle, the boss at front soaks the damage while the abandoned isomers slowly closes in and stun everyone.
- If it's stunned during moving, the abandoned isomer's stun itself will be skipped.

### Roarer
![roarer](/assets/sc-mobs/03-roarer.png)
- This is a normal mob. Purple will deal 45x damage to it
- Its armor is relatively low, a bit like Manticores.
- Immune to stuns.
- It will taunt attack when it glows blue. The mechanics is a bit like Contender's skill.
![roarer](/assets/sc-mobs/03-roarer.gif)
- However, skills that has its own targeting mechanism will override it.
![roarer](/assets/sc-mobs/04-roarer.gif)
- SMG and HG can trigger the blue ball attack by walking up to it. When it raises its hand above its head, walking away will cause the attack to miss.
![roarer](/assets/sc-mobs/05-roarer.gif)
- Take note that moving away does not interrupt the attack. So if the kiting unit moves away too early, it can potentially cause the attack to splah the back line.
![roarer](/assets/sc-mobs/06-roarer.gif)
- If the dolls are hit by the blue ball attack, its movement speed and rate of fire is decreased.
![roarer](/assets/sc-mobs/07-roarer.gif)
- Roarer's blue ball attack can miss and hit empty air.
![roarer](/assets/sc-mobs/08-roarer.gif)
- The blue ball attack link splashes, so shield can work effectively against it. The blue ball attack deals 80% of its firepower stats. It mostly deals around 30 to 40 damage per link in SC.
![roarer](/assets/sc-mobs/09-roarer.gif)
- Normal attack is melee and doesn't seem to do much. Taunt often fails to block the ones walking down side lanes.
- It can replenish its own force field. It replenishes 300 at a time. HOC can deal with these units quite easily. However, if the fight drags on for too long without HOC, they can become hard to kill.


### Thunder
![thunder](/assets/sc-mobs/10-thunder.png)
- This enemy is an elite. Purple does not do :bigd:
- It has 100+ armor. RF would not have much problem with it, but desert eagle would struggle.
- It does not come with other enemy in SC.
- It is immune to stun.
- It has an mode cycle of 16s. 10s shield and 6s evasion.
- Because it always comes single linked, so its normal attack in shield mode isn't too threatening. However its shield is really, really, really thick. Evasion mode attacks twice, fixed. The attack is guaranteed to hit and does not do link splash damage. It will jump to a fixed distance in front of the attack target.
- It will attack the taunt in evasive mode and not hit the backline. If it attacks the front row doll, it may hit the backline.
![thunder](/assets/sc-mobs/11-thunder.gif)
- Currently, using sure hit skills to kill it during the evasion mode seems to be the better way to approach this enemy.
- AR echelons with type 59 can get by.
- Desert eagle can attack it during the shield mode.
- HOC has 40% base hit rate. If the team can last long enough, you can whittle it down with HOC.

### Gunners
![gunners](/assets/sc-mobs/12-streletes-plus.png)
- 50+ FP and evasion debuff. This thing hurts like hell against evasion tanks and easily critically damage HGs.
- One of the few rare units from paradeus that will chew through taunt.
- There are normal and special attacks from these guys. Blue bullets are the special attack and green bullets are normal attack.
![gunners](/assets/sc-mobs/13-streletes-plus.gif)
- its skill has 3s icd and 3s cd. Every time it uses its skill, the hit target accuracy and evasion will be debuffed by 20%. Maximum 3 stacks for a total of 48.8% decrease.
![gunners](/assets/sc-mobs/14-streletes-plus.gif)
- These guys cannot be kited. Once locked on, they attack 100% lands.
- 0 AP. They do not have armor penetration rating. However, whether shotguns are suitable in tanking them are something else altogether.


## KCCO

### Orthos

A.k.a doggos.

![orthos](/assets/sc-mobs/15-beast.png)
- KCCO's hound at the front in the usual dog/archer comp. It has relatively low hp and has 10 evasion.
- When the battle starts, the first batch of dogs will attack once and deploy shield. Try not to let the backline get hit.
- Normal attack ignores armor. 140 accuracy.
- Shield has 3s icd, a start up animation of 1s, duration of 6s and a cooldown of 8s. So there's a 2s window without shield.
- Don't use pure FP skills, such as grizzly and sop nade, when the shield is active. Wait until the shield is down then nuke it.
- The HP shield strength is equal to 0.8% of the current HP. In the ex ranking  
  Orthos + cyclops comp have HP value of 3740x5. Full hp shield is 150  
  4 Orthos + 3 Kentaoros comp have HP value of 2800x5. Full hp shield is 112  
  3 Orthos + 4 Kentaoros comp have HP value of 3740x5. Full hp shield is 150
- When the HP shield is exausted, the dog will be hit with a high value link based damage. The image shows 7700 damage to the Orthos itself.
![orthos](/assets/sc-mobs/16-beast.jpg)
- Usually there are 3 ways to approach this enemy
  1. decrease the HP value before the HP shield is deployed
  2. Increase the attack speed when HP shield is deployed
  3. Ignore them and attack the backline
- About reducing its HP before the HP shield is active
  If the echelon can burst enough damage at the start, the fight will be a lot easier. K2 is well positioned to burst at start and attack in multi hits. 
  If day battle, MG is worth considering
- Note, if the dogs are stunned when the HP shield is deployed, it will not damage itself when the HP shield is depleted.
![orthos](/assets/sc-mobs/17-beast.png)
- About the attack frequency, use ROF buff tdolls and/or dolls that attack multiple hits. SMG/HG equipped with PEQ should also be considered. They can help whittle down the shield while buffing ROF for others.
- In this ranking event, most relies on HOC + RFB/Hanyang to deal with them.

### Kentaoros

A.k.a archers.

![archers](/assets/sc-mobs/18-archer.png)
- These enemies have range even further than SWAP Jaegers. So our backline will get hit while out of range sometimes.
- Two ways to make them enter attack range
  1. Have dolls on the last two columns and move forward when the archers are close enough.
  2. Only have dolls on the last column
- Rocket bomb have an icd of 5s, cd of 6s and a warning sign of 1.5s  
  It deals 60% of its FP in link based splash damage. It's usually around 17.  
  Not sure about the dot. Usually 5 points of link based splash damage.
- It attacks relatively slowly as it comes in range. This turns into a disgusting situation where the ground is all covered by the warning sign.
![archers](/assets/sc-mobs/19-archer.gif)
- P90's illusion can soak up 1 round of these rockets. Shield's also relatively effective.
- They are not really tough, so can use dolls that attack backline directly.
- In most battles, its threat level is usually determined by how thick the meat shield at the front is.


### Minotaur

![minotaur](/assets/sc-mobs/20-tesla-trooper.png)
- This is not an elite and will be dealt 45x damage by grape.
- Immune to stun
- They have relatively high shield value. 150 hp in the ex ranking map.
- 10 evasion so MG is not an option in the night.
- Damage reduction have an icd of 4s, cd of 8s, start up animation of 1s and duration of 5s. It basically will reduce damage when it stops walking.
- Damage is 80%. Grape can use the 1s start up time to one shot it. Otherwise, one shot it regardless with enough FP buff.
- Apparently stun can interrupt the damage reduction.
- Normal attack electrifies the dolls and deal 30% FP in link based splash damage. It's usually around 10 give or take.
  The full attack hits 6 times so one round of shield skill may not be enough.
- It's usually not possible to dodge its attack by moving left. It's usually done by moving up or down, but this will let them through.
- If it attacks the frontline on the front column, upon retreat the tdoll, these will not be able to hit dolls on the back column
- The electric attack does not ignore armor, so M4 and SG take very little damage from it.
![minotaur](/assets/sc-mobs/21-tesla-trooper.gif)
- Grenade bombardment has an icd of 16s. It only happen once per battle. The grenades deal 80% of its FP in link based splash damage. Each round is around 30 to 40 damage. Each minotaur will hit 4 squares.
- It's usual cycle is
  1. walk up
  2. deploy shield
  2. electrify
  3. grenade
  4. deploy shield
  4. electrify
  5. deploy shield
  6. repeat 4 and 5
![minotaur](/assets/sc-mobs/22-tesla-trooper.gif)
- Killing them at the start of the battle before they get close is the way to go. This is how they are mostly deal with in this
  ranking event. Otherwise, grape skillshot when their shield is down / strong FP buff is another option. Usually they should not be allowed to let the grenade off.
