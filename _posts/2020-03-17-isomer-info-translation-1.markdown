## Map Breakdown

1. Helipads (including heavy helipads); Red Area
    - High probability to spawn paradeus enemies and low probability to spawn zombies.
    - Mid to late game they spawn enemise with force shield. It is recommended to station HOC around this area.
    - We'll need to cap 1 heavy helipad in order to deploy 3 HOC. However, all the rest can be kept to farm enemy spawns.
2. Supply line area; Blue Area
    - The center of the supply area is marked with a star. There's a control tower on it. The control
      tower controls 6 missile turrets (on / off) around it. The 6 turrets cannot be destroyed by stepping
      on it. They have to be destroyed with HOC. (10k points each)
    - There's only 2 enemies in this area. The zombies will not move across the sanitising tower into the
      supply area. Therefore no need to leave echelon here to defend.
    - One enemy is the zombie boss and a group of 100k Hydras. They patrol counter clockwise.
    - Seems like standing on the center of the supply area will aggro the zombie.
3. Zombie area; Green Area
    - All helipads spawn zombie enemies only.
    - Zombies do not move out of the area. However they will aggro near by echelons.
    - Any echelon will be able to handle mobs in this area but the points are low.
    - After switching on two control tower 2 the area will be sanitised temporarily. This has a cooldown of 3 turns.
    - Sanitation tower can be blown up for 10k (note SKK this will deduct karma points IRL)
4. KCCO area; Yellow Area
    - The four helipads spawn KCCO enemies. 50% of the time they spawn cyclops with evasion.
    - Note the CE varies between 20 and 60k.
    - You have to kill 2 groups of 100k Hydras. ??Use high equip rf team, can use SL to force
      enemy turret to bomb HG. Can brute force this way??
    - Blowing up the bridge is 10k points.
5. Sangvis Ferris area; Pink Area
    - Need to blow up the boulders to get in.
    - All helipads spawn patrol alert enemy. They will turn into boss enemy at start of your turn.
    - There are 5 boss enemies in total; Executioner, Intruder, Alchemist, Dreamer and our big bro M16.
    - We should not kill these patrols before they turn into boss (since they worth a lot of points)
    - These boss' points are not proportional to their CE. E.g. M16 has 35888CE but is worth 22k points.

## Echelon comp

In this rankings map, paradeus heavy units (gundams, tanks) has certain level of eva as well as high armor.
KCCO area also has cyclops with evasion. This means that there's little use of MG. Therefore, this rankings
event, RF will be our main force.

I personally believe a good echelon composition is 3 AR 6 RF + double jupiter.

### AR teams
- 1 of the 3 AR can specialise in FP buff with 2 shield HG used to kill bosses.
- The other 2 ARs are for zombies. These can be SG + grenade + shield comp to clean out the zombie area
- Double jupiter team can deal with any enemy in this event. Anything you are not sure, nuke 'em with jupiter canons.
- Fairies with ACC buff should given to the RF team, and every team should have an ACC buff HG.

### RF teams
- Even without duping, there's a lot of options; WA, Lee Enfield, IWS, M14, FN49, G28, SVD, Carcano sisters, Mosin Nagant
  SRS, T5k, M82A1, MK12, K31. Of which SRS and T5k are considered tier 1 as they have ACC buff in their skill. K31 otoh
  are considered an inferior option.
- Fairies to go with RF include warrior, fury, taunt, rescue, golden, airstrike (illumination, fireworks)

### HOC
HOCs are considered the MVP of this event. Anywhere 2b14 can reach is considered our holy sanctum. With fire support, RF
team has little concern on how to deal with strelete and survive. This lowers the composition design considerably. Of
course when it gets to mid and late game, BGM and AGS are crucial for dealing with units that have strong force shield.

BGM and AGS needs to be enhanced moderately. 2B14 needs to be enhanced considerably.

With regard to encountering enemies you can't kill, this is what you do:

### An approach for tackling 1 ~ 1.2m

In this approach, we use 3 parachute fairies and 1 illumination fairy. The three parachute are not mandatory. You only
need minimum one. Specific strategy can be adjusted on the fly. This forms 3 AR 6 RF and 1 2x Jupiter echelon.

The below reference echelons
- 1 and 2 are zombie teams
- 7 is KCCO. The rest are general echelons mainly used for paradeus.
- Double jupiter is for zombie boss and hydras. (No rarity requirement)

Reference Echelons (No dupe) (Slightly outdated)

Of these echelons, the 2 AR should be changed to grenade + SG + shield. The echelon mixed with MG should be changed
to pure RF.

From echelon 1 to 10:

How to get high score in this rankings event? First priority obviously is the paradeus area that yield the most score.
We should try to avoid capping the helipad other than the heavy helipad at the bottom. In my approach, I capped a few
helipads due to Action Point issues but these helipads should be returned ASAP.

After taking care of the paradues, we need to deal with:
- connection of supply line
- clean up of the zombies, SF, KCCO
- it's best to complete them sooner than later

After balancing all the elements, the following opening is what I consider to be optimal:
