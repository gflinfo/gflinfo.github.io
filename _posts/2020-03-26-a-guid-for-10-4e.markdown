For 10-4E grape drag, there's a few key requirements.
- Crit chance of 100%
- FP * Crit Damage * 0.85 >= 534 (Cyclop's HP, per link)
- FP * 0.85 * 45 >= 9000 (Hydra's HP, per link. Almost never an issue)
- Certain ROF threshold (calico highly recommended)
- After that, stack more ROF and accuracy.

A note before I dive into detail for each of them. The above requirements
mostly come from the need to one shot cyclops with Grape. The easiest way
to do that is to ensure 100% crit chance and pump FP high enough. After that,
stack acc and rof to reduce damage (rof preferrably)

## Layout

Grape on position 2. Position 3 will take some scratch damage. Occasional grenade damage on pos 4 and 5.

## Crit chance of 100%

This is an easy one so let's just get it out of the way.

If you have a gold max calibrated and enhanced VFL:
1. RF has base crit chance of 40%
2. Maxed VFL is 48%
3. 100 / (40 + 48) = 1.1363636... ~= 1.14

So with a gold maxed VFL, you need 14% crit buff. Literally (correct me
if I'm wrong) any doll with crit buff tile can achieve this:
- PPK
- Python
- 5-7
- Contender
- Nagant Revolver

You'll need one of the above. This is probably the most flexible spot. If
you don't have a fully maxed out VFL, plug in the numbers and see which one
to use.

## FP requirement

Thing to note here, any FP more beyond the minimum is waste.

```
FP * Crit Damage * 0.85 >= 534 (Cyclop's HP, per link)
```

This one will be different for everyone as different fairies of different
rarity and levels will have different FP / Crit Dmg buff.

Essentially:

FP buff >= 629 / FP / Crit Damage

So taking the following example. With a 4* lvl 94 command fairy

![4* command](/assets/10-4e-guide/fp1.png)

Grape has 198 dmg and 199% + 25% crit damage (with maxed gold cape).

Plugging in the numbers: 629 / 198 (FP) / 2.24 (crit dmg 1.99 + 0.25) = 1.41819
So I need to plug in 42% FP buff to reliably one shot cyclops.

Note, the stats displayed already factors in the fairy buff.

![4* mortar](/assets/10-4e-guide/fp2.png)

Grape has 221 dmg and 150% + 25% crit damage (with maxed gold cape).

Plugging in the numbers: 629 / 221 (FP) / 1.75 (crit dmg 1.50 + 0.25) = 1.62637
So I need to plug in 63% FP to reliably one shot cyclops.

3* command fairy is usually what's recommended for the beginning requirement.
As you can see command fairy is pretty good for filling in the damage requirement
but it's not exactly impossible with other fairies.

## ROF requirement

This one I'm currently less clear on, so if anyone has additional info to fill in
please let me know.

Currently, what is known is lvl 100 grape with calico + another ROF buffer is enough.
This 53 rof, or rather 54% rof buff. Just chuck calico + someone else in and you should be fine.

![rof and cyclops](assets/10-4e-guide/cyclops.png)

There are 3 of these mobs on your farming route.
1. Grape will target the top most cyclop first
  - If Grape 1 shot kills it with no misses, you are safe. /the end.
  - However, if Grape misses any of the 5 bullets she shoots she will need to shoot at it again.
2. When Grape shoots the top cycolops twice, she will need to one shot the second cyclops if she's to clear the cyclops before hydras.
3. If Grape fails to kill BOTH cyclops in one shot, she will skip the third cyclops and start shooting
the top hydra. There's a good chance the last cyclop will launch a grenade.
4. It's not the end of the world if the last cyclop launches a grenade as it'll target either position 5 or 3.
It'll be another bit of RNG whether grape will be hit on position 2 or not.

This is the node you want to watch in terms of ROF buff. These are the symptoms of not enough ROF:
- Two shotting first cyclops and one shotting second, grape starts shooting the hydras.
- One shotting first cyclops and two shotting second cyclops, grape starts shooting the hydras.

If you have enough FP x ROF, you might be able to kill the cyclops in scenario 4 before the grenade is launched.

I have not yet seen all three cyclops cleared when first 2 needed 2 shots to kill each.

## Accuracy requirement

Before we start, keep in mind that it is IMPOSSIBLE to not miss. acc / (acc + eva) is asymptotic. You can get
close to 100% but you will never be. As well, it has diminishing returns.

Stacking accuracy a bit can be helpful. ideally 100% or above.

Again, calico is really good here as she also buffs accuracy.

Here's some maths to put things into perspective.

Let's take an arbitrary 140% acc buff for example (calico/m1911 mod/k5)

95 base acc becoming 228. Cyclops have eva of 15
```
Your hit chance = 228/(228+15) = 93.8%
```

For grape to "1 shot" the cyclops, all 5 bullets have to land.
This means that the chance to 1 shot the cyclops is:
```
0.938 ^ 5 = 0.7271815 = 73%
```

As previous section mentions, if you miss "1 shot" on first 2 cyclops, you are likely to eat a 'nade.
(1-0.73) ^ 2 = 0.07 = 7%

So in about every 5 runs, you are likely to eat a grenade.

At the end of the day, it just helps you decrease damage taken / reduce repairs. Nothing too critical here.

## Example comps

Before I begin, again Calico is a given.

So let's take for example, starting with a 4* command fairy from before:

![4* command](/assets/10-4e-guide/fp1.png)

We need 42% FP buff.

If we use Python as the crit buffer, she has 30% damage. I'll only need another 12% after that. That's literally
any FP buffer. From this point I can plug in K5 / PX4 / Welrod / even Makarov. I will throw in M1911 to further
buff ROF/ACC for good measure.

x      | x     | x
Calico | M1911 | x
Python | Grape | K5

If we use PPK as the crit buffer, she has no dmg buff. She can only sit on 1 or 3 to buff Grape and I really don't
want her taking scrat dmg as she's made of paper. (PPK, I'm telling you. no means no!) This means I need dmg buffer
on 5 and 3 enough for 42%. Spitfire (30%) and Welrod (20%) would do. As well it gets some decent acc/rof buff.
As well, Welrod is tanky.

x      | x        | x
Calico | Spitfire | x
PPK    | Grape    | Welrod

In a pinch, I can swap Welrod above with Makarov for repairing scratch damage too.

As you can see, by mixing and matching HG buffs this way, one can drag quite a wide range of HGs to level 100.
