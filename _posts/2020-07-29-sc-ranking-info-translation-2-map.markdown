## Map overview.
1. Isomer scoring mechanics
2. Friendly echelons. There are five of these in total when the mission starts. Found out that they are surprisinlgy strong when I accidentally let them engage the enemy once. Although there's no point given for enemy killed by these echelons. These friend echelons don't turn into hostages like in Isomer, but they are worth 15k points each when the mission ends for a total of 15000*5 = 75000 points.
3. Artilleries. There are 14 in total. Each one are worth 10k points when destroyed. Note that these cannot be destroyed by moving an echelon into them. Also if they are captured, they cannot be destroyed. All artilleries near the supply route should be destroyed when the mission starts.
4. Supply route. Note, the red star to the upper left is the start of the supply route. It's quite close to the HQ and can be connected on turn 1. Its position does not change.

## Zombie area. The upper right green zone.
1. The 4 helipads to the north all spawn zombies only.
2. Buildings and demolishing switch. Echelons standing on the buildings receives a buff (and so does the enemy). The exact buff is not known. Also, pressing the switch in the red circle will make boulders with 400 toughness appear in the orange circles. Each boulder is worth 10k points. There are 9 in total.

## Paradeus area. The lower right red area.
1. The helipads spawn all kinds of paradeus units. Please refer to the 3rd section for how to approach the enemies.
2. Contamination area. This time the contaimnation will spread every turn until the 5th turn. But the damage dealt by the contamination is far weaker than lst time. The most damage it will deal is up to a third of the max HP. If HOC stay in the contamination zone, they will be damaged too. They can, however, continue to function in the mission.
3. Lost Isomer - The only boss in this ranking map. There's a 80k and 140k CE version. Spawn condition are to be verified.
4. Abandoned Isomer - Note the abandoned isomers on the map. The exclamation mark will trigger a dialogue saying "do not come closer arghhhhhh". When the boss Lost Isomer is killed, Abandoned one will turn into a friendly M4. The purpose of this M4 is unclear, though she seems to be worth 15k points.

## KCCO area. The lower left yellow area.
1. The enemy spawns include the new doggos + archer units. Hydras, aegis/cerynitis. Every single helipad in the area will spawn enemies
2. HQ. It's same as Isomer where the functionality is unknown other than that it provides 10k points.
3. Enemy Railgun. The name is Argonauts - Vela. The name sounds pretty cool, and it's also pretty impressive in action. Though it's only 80k CE which is not a lot. It's support area is like our friendly rail gun, a range of 4. However Argonauts have a minimum range of 2, so she does not support in the immediate range. Currently there's a bug with the rail gun picking up the target. If you can't see her, she will not provide support. Specifically the HOC support sign on the enemy's head shows whether Argonauts will provide support or not. However, note that resetting client at end of turn combat will cause the Argonauts to provide support.
