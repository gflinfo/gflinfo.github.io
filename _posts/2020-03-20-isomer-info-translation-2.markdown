## Team Prep

### tier 1 units:
m4a1, grape

HS2K: Can whield while also adding to the dmg output. Recommended to pair up with taunt. Shield

protects you from grenade shower.

### Strong units:
Doggo mod2 (Sopmod mod2): High stats, AR night accuracy, stronk grenade to clear the field.

M16: hard as a rock. Feeling right at home as though it's 0-2. Stun helps with CC except gundam/uhlans.

P22: excellent front row HG

PX4: excellent front row HG, need to pair with crit HG

Python: Excellent dmg output and buff. Can use PEQ. Against evasive units, the dmg output rivals RF.
No need to stack rof for the sake of it.

Contender: Focus fire mechanism useful against 3 gundam squad.

#### Friendly Invite:
SG: "Didn't know we can wear PEQ did you"

Lion King Jr (SAT8): Strong sustainability

Giant Rabbit (Elphelt): Rocket to clear the field.

MDR: Help shield the SGs.

MG: ~~All useless~~  
Recommend Hunting Impulse MG. RF team with MG are recommended for KCCO.

ARSMG: Zombie team. Not much to look into.

### Fairy Selection:

- Para: Strong aura.  
  Usage:
    1. Early game - Capping helipads near the sanitation tower
    2. Mid late game - Capping strategic points. Often used with RF team.  
       Strongly recomend pairing with 59/water gun (SPP1)
- Warrior: Strong aura, accuracy  
  Usage: General use. Savior for players with weaker teams. SL10 Warrior makes it possible
  to kill hydras with enemy missile turret.
- Taunt: Low rarity taunt not recommended.
  Usage: Althought useful for stopping gundams, it cause them to launch grenade shower.
  Highly recommend to pair with HS2K (crate doll). If so, then it's possible to kill random
  mobs without taking too much damage, if at all. Very good performance that way.
- Illumination: Accuracy + crit dmg.
  Usage: Help hoc blow up stuff. Mid / late game help find the enemies.

Simple description for the rest:
- Shield Fairy: ARSMG use only. Shield count as one hit for AOE damage. If jupiter team
  is not strong, shielded AR team can easily handle Nyto boss.
- Reinforcement fairy: Can be used for sustainability in zombie area. Though para is usually used.
- Mortar: Strong aura. Can train up the skill level. Mortar damage often is MVP.
- Airstrike: High rarity can be useful.
- Fury: High rarity ones can be similar to warrior for RF teams.
- Rescue, command, golden: Can be used, but nothing too special.
- Fireworks fairy: Strongest acc aura (as good as SPP1). Skill usage can be costly in terms of
  fairy points
- Rocket, construction, barrier, defense: Not great.


### Team Comps:

#### Grape team
- Main: Grape, Pink
- Secondary:
    1. Secondary rifle / grenade AR / star15
    2. Python / HS2K / regular HG
    3. Front front column HG
    4. M16/SG
- Reference video: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/av43485041/?p=1](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av43485041/?p=1)
- Main battles: Taking care of paradeus while receiving little damage.  
  To kill high force shield gundams with help of weak HOC.
  ~~Gape save me. Grape teams circle the base every turn~~
- Additional notes:
  - Pink / Python / front column hg: Strengthen grape sniping.
  - Grenade AR / Armored dolls: low damage dealing with paradeus
  - HS2K: More reliable against gundams
  - Special note: Against hydra + missile turrets, do not recommend AR/pink/sg.
    pink python kiting breaks python damage chain.
  - For reliable gundam clearing, highly recommend one of: HS2K/Pink
- Recommend 1-7 teams

#### Vape zone AR
- Main: Grenade AR (Sopmod, HK416, FAL, G3 mod), sg, any hg
- Secondary: Strong night AR.
- Unimportant: SMG
- Special: SAT8, LWMMG mod2, MDR, P22, HS2K
- Main battles: So long as SG have more than 1 HP, reliably kill zombies.
- Note:
  - recommend SG to have 34 armor minimum
  - Fairy recommend para > reinforcement
  - Damage not important
  - After entering vape zone, can cap the helipad. Don't need to worry about zombie spawn.
- Recommend 2 teams

#### RFHG
- Main: rf, hg
- Secondary: Five-seveN + px4, hs2k + taunt
- Special: python
- Main battles: KCCO bruteforce and clean up, nyto zone clean up.
- KCCO recommendation:
  - KCCO needs usually 2 RF
  - People who have weaker rifle team would use one team to bruteforce hydras and typhons.
    Remember to change formation for typhons.
  - Use warrior if you have weak rifle team. No need to stack ACC.
  - Only weak rifle team required for KCCO clean up. Retreat on the spot after using up the ammo.
- Personal take on RF ACC stacking:
  1. non-acc fairy + HG (t59/spp/2 acc buff hg)
  2. Fireworks fairy
  3. ACC fairy + 1 ACC buff hg.
- Recommend 1 ~ 7 teams

#### 2x jupiter
- Main: M4A1 (PEQ), self buff RF
- Recommended: Welrod (benefit is obvious when fighting boss), p22
- Main battles: all boss. can kill mid/high force shield gundam with weak HOC support
- Recommended Fairy:
  - Taunt: 3* can be used for SF M16. Other fairy is going to be hard for Nyto with summoning skills
  - Fairy with strong aura: High rarity fairy can be used to kill Nyto with summoning skills.
    This is also more suitable for dealing with gundams.
- Note: I personally don't recommend IWS. Also, while necessary, don't overstack rof.
  Reason: RF generally deal the same damage to Nyto herself. However, SF jaegers have low HP and
  small amount of evasion. This causes IWS to severely over kill while requiring same number of
  attack count. However IWS is really slow.  
  Though, sometimes there's not enough RF and with support of 2B14, IWS can still be used.

#### ARSMG
- Clearing hoppers and zombies. Strong ARSMG is very resilient.
- Remember to bring RFB, AUG, K11 for clearing trash.
- Can consider 2 HG
- ARSMG is excellent for Nyto. Focussing on a strong ARSMG is a good consideration.  
  e.g. P22, CMS, UMP45, AR15, RFB, high rarity fairy.
- ~~STAR15 is so much better than shrimp~~
- Recommend: 1 ~ 2 teams
